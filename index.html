                                The secret of real meat is the correctly selected beef breed of Aberdeen Angus steers, fattening with grain grown in farm fields, processing at the latest automated enterprise and quality control at all stages of production. Marbled beef is meat with high fat concentration.<br><br>

Marbled beef steaks are the standard of rich taste, juiciness and tenderness of meat dishes. The character of the steak largely depends on the cut (part of the carcass) from which it is made. Middle cuts are known all over the world for the simplicity of cooking and guaranteed excellent results, secondary cuts are popular among experienced cooks for a rich range of flavors and a variety of serving.<br><br>

We distribute a full range of premium and secondary cuts and steaks from marbled beef.

Cattle grows without the usage of antibiotics and growth hormones. All steers gain weight under comfortable and humane farming conditions- firstly on the farms and pastures, then in the specialized fattening facilities. Minimum contact with humans help the cattle grow without stress, which improves qualities of meat.

                                Wagyu is a world–famous delicacy that, along with sushi and sake, has become a symbol of the Land of the Rising Sun. There are legends about the cultivation of steers of this breed: as if on Japanese farms they are soldered off with beer and sake, massaged daily and hung on belts so that the animal moves as little as possible.
However, in fact, to get real Wagyu beef, you only need the best genetics, the right nutrition system and completely stress-free content. Bulls are fattened according to the Slow Grow system for 500 days on a diet of corn, silage and pure spring water. This allows them to gain weight gradually, so fat is formed inside the muscles and creates marbling.

                                Free grazing of animals is one of the main conditions for their maintenance, thanks to which farmers get healthy cattle.
The diet of animals includes both herbs and hay, as well as cereals. Thanks to such a combined diet, bulls grow up healthy, with strong immunity and developed muscle mass.
The natural conditions in which the bulls live, minimal interference in their lives by people and careful care affect the quality of the finished product. Observing fairly simple principles of keeping and raising livestock, manufacturers get delicious and tender meat.

And because of that our pork meets all modern quality standards. We also distribute Tender Pork
which is our new unique product. Pig meat undergoes a wet aging procedure — then it is packed in vacuum bags and store it in special rooms for three weeks. This is the optimal period for which pork acquires a rich and unusual taste, becomes especially soft and tender. Now everyone can cook an exquisite meat delicacy in their own kitchen without much effort!
